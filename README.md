## Business Questions
- What are the dominant themes across Nike's product range?
- How do product descriptions vary by category, and what does this tell us about Nike's marketing strategies?
- How are premium products differentiated in their descriptions?

## Data Source
We used a dataset compiled from Nikeâ€™s official website, employing web scraping techniques for data collection.

## Methodology
The project utilizes Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for theme discovery in product descriptions and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for text classification. These machine learning techniques uncover marketing language and product categorization based on textual data.

## Key Findings
- **Theme Discovery**: Identified themes related to performance, design, comfort, and material in Nike's product range.
- **Text Classification**: Successfully classified Nike products into categories based on their descriptions, demonstrating the potential for automated product categorization in e-commerce.

## Recommendations
- Enhance marketing messages to highlight identified themes more prominently.
- Standardize product descriptions to reflect marketing focus more clearly.
- Differentiate premium products in descriptions to highlight their unique value. 

## Business Value
These insights and recommendations aim to improve product development, refine marketing strategies, and enhance consumer satisfaction, ensuring Nike's continued growth and industry leadership.

## Conclusion
Our analysis provides a fresh perspective on Nike's product strategy and customer engagement, demonstrating the power of machine learning in uncovering valuable insights from textual data.
